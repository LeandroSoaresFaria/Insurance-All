# 1. Business Problem.

Insurance All is a company that provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: Auto insurance. As with health insurance, customers of this new auto insurance plan need to pay an amount annually to Insurance All to obtain an amount insured by the company, intended for the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle.

# 2. Business Assumptions.
By contacting some customers by phone, the company was relatively successful with solid results after offering the product to approximately 380,000 customers. However, the high operating costs made the execution of the operation prohibitive for the 127 thousand new customers who still do not know the offer. So the company turned to a data science consultancy, hoping that the customer data in its database could help minimize costs, and clear up some doubts.


# 3. Solution Strategy

My strategy to solve this challenge was:

**Step 01. Data Description**
- Features Description 
- Data Dimentions
- Data Types
- Check NA
- Change Types
- Descriptive Statistical
**Step 02. Feature Engineering**

**Step 03. Data Filtering**

**Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis**

**Step 05. Data Preparation**

**Step 06. Feature Selection**

**Step 07. Machine Learning Modelling**

**Step 08. Hyperparameter Fine Tunning**

**Step 09. Convert Model Performance to Business Values**

**Step 10. Deploy Modelo to Production**

# 4. Top 3 Data Insights

**Hypothesis 01:** Female customers should want more a motor ensurance. 

**False.** Males want more motor ensurance then females

# 7. Business Results
**With the result shown above, we managed to reach more than 80% of the customers in the base, and with a profit of approximately 60%.**

# 8. Conclusions
- The project achieved its objective, which was to optimize the sale of insurance to customers likely to accept it.

# 9. Lessons Learned
- Deploy using google sheets.
- Classification model for database ranking

# 10. Next Steps to Improve
