# Insurance All

#### This project was made by Leandro Faria.

# 1. Business Problem.

Insurance All is a company that provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: Auto insurance. As with health insurance, customers of this new auto insurance plan need to pay an amount annually to Insurance All to obtain an amount insured by the company, intended for the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle.

# 2. Business Assumptions.
By contacting some customers by phone, the company was relatively successful with solid results after offering the product to approximately 380,000 customers. However, the high operating costs made the execution of the operation prohibitive for the 127 thousand new customers who still do not know the offer. So the company turned to a data science consultancy, hoping that the customer data in its database could help minimize costs, and clear up some doubts.
